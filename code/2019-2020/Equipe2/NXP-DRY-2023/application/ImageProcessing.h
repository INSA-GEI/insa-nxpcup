	Two threshold functionning : 
		For a pixel P(x), having gradient magnitude G, following conditions exists to detect a pixel as edge :
			- if G < threshold_low then discard the edge
			- if G > threshold_high then keep the edge
			- if threshold_low < G < threshold_high and if any neighbour three units away have gradient magnitude greater than threshold_high, keep the edge
			- if no neighbour in this regions have gradient > threshold_high, search the 5 units away for threshold_low < gradient < threshold_high. 
				If so, keep the edge
			- else : discard the edge.
