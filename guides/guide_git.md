# Git and GitHub 101
#### Authors: Triet NGUYEN (Github: trietngh)

A simple guide for Git. Feel free to contribute.

## Install Git

### For Linux
Git is already installed by default, you can skip to the setup part (but I assume that you know how to use it already)

### For Windows
1. Télécharger Git via this [link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Install Git, you can leave all options as the default unless you know what you are doing.

## Setup Git
1. Configure the username

`git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"`

2. Configure the mail address

`git config --global user.email “YOUR.EMAIL”`
